# CS305

### Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?
Artemis Financial is a financial services company that needed stronger security for its web application. The company wanted secure communication, encryption, and protection against vulnerabilities to safeguard client data.

### What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?
I was thorough in identifying and documenting vulnerabilities, then applying fixes based on best practices. Secure coding prevents exploits, protects sensitive data, and builds trust with customers. Strong security also reduces legal, financial, and reputational risks.

### Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
Running the dependency-check and interpreting which findings were real issues versus false positives was challenging but very helpful. It gave me hands on experience with industry tools and showed me the importance of reviewing results carefully.

### How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
I added encryption, secure certificates, and stronger exception handling to create multiple layers of defense. In the future, I’d continue using tools like dependency-check and follow secure coding guidelines to choose the best mitigations.

### How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
I tested the application manually and confirmed HTTPS endpoints worked correctly. After refactoring, I re-ran dependency-check and reviewed the code to make sure no new weaknesses were introduced.

### What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
I used Java’s built-in security libraries, Maven dependency-check, and secure coding guidelines. These tools and practices will continue to help me write safer and reliable applications in the future.

### Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
I could show the final secure application and report, which demonstrate my ability to identify vulnerabilities, apply encryption and secure communication, and document my work clearly. I believe they're a strong example of both technical and professional skills.
